Movie Recommender.
1)My program decides to pick a great movie 
2)I used nested elif for the "friends" category. It is not just picks movie, it asks question about the genres. 
3)The AI prompt that helped me the most was asking to make a movie recommender with innovative code that will feel like a real person is talking to you
For and while Loop Programming examples.
1) A for loop is better when the count in advance
A while loop is better when you don't know at all where do you need to stop
2)  When I started a while loop but forgot to include a way to turn it off. Because the condition was always "True," the program started printing text forever and wouldn't stop until I forced the computer to quit
Rock,Paper,Scissors Game
1)I gave each function one role.
The Inputters: (Player & Computer) just get the moves.
The Judge: (determine_winner) only decides who won.
The Manager: (play_game) keeps the score and runs the show.
2) The player's choice function was the hardest, because i had to use "while loop" to keep asking "rock,paper,scissors?" until the player typed a real answer. For example, when u type instead of "rock,paper,scissors" another word such as "pen", the computer will ask to try again and it will say "try again!"
3) It's better because it's easier to read and fix.
4) As for my previous programs I asked Ai to be stylish and innovative. Also I asked to give each step its own function to make it easier to understand
